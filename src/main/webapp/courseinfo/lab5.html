		<h3>Lab 5: Cookies</h3>

		<p>In this exercise, you will build a servlet that deals with cookies (sending and retrieving)</p>

		<h5>Prerequisites:</h5>
		<ul>
		    <li>Configuring the server-side project: If you do not have it, follow the <a href="https://github
		    .com/marciofk/jee-course-lab-server" target="_blank">installation instructions</a></li>
		    <li>Starting the client-side project: If you do not have it, follow the <a href="https://github.com/marciofk/jee-course-lab-client#starting-the-client-app" target="_blank">instructions</a></li>

   		<p>Open the <a href="http://localhost:8090/" target="_blank">client application</a> and login with a valid user

   		<p>For this exercise, you will use cookies to store the last login for further usage, as well as track
   		the number of successful login attempts.

        <div class="panel-body">

   		<p>In your server-side project, modify the Login servlet to:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>If the user and password are valid, create and send a cookie called <i>email</i>, containing the
            parameter sent by the user. This cookie must be valid for one day and all paths of the host (see the method
            setPath of Cookie)</li>

            <li>To track successful attempts, use a cookie called <i>visits</i>. First, check if the client sent
            this cookie. If yes, retrieve the value, increment it, and send back the cookie to the client. If the
            cookie is not present in the request, it means that this is the first time that the client is logging
            in. If this is the case, assume the value as zero</li>
        </ol>
